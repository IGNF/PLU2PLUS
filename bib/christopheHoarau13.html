    abstract = {Is aesthetics an objective in the map design process? This question echoes our long-term research: does aesthetic quality improve map efficiency? In this paper, we discuss the notions of aesthetic response, objective and experience proposed by Kent (2005), and their relevance for making more expressive personalized maps. We first present the state of present research related to these notions and our interpretations. Then we present asystematic approach for rendering geographic data in a cartographic style based on the visual properties of Pop Art; the resulting maps are more vibrant and expressive. We consider this result a first step towards enhancing map quality. The proposition of a Pop Art cartographic style leads us to revisit some theoretical and practical principles of Semiology of Graphics (Bertin 1967), considering our experience with color contrasts and new approach for using texture. We conclude that expressive cartographic renderings would be useful for every mapmaker, and in the context of personalized map design, providing more elaborate tools could improve the design process and the resultant maps. Improving map quality is a question of managing visual variables in a traditional way—according to Bertin's Semiology of Graphics—but also in a more artistic way, in order to find better cartographic representation according to the preferences, needs, and purposes of the mapmaker.},
